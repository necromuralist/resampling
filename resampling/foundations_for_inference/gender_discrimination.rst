2.1 Gender Discrimination
=========================

Background
----------

In 1972 48 bank supervisors were asked to review a case file to decide if the person deserved a promotion. The managers were all male and the files were all identical but half the files were labeled male and half were labeled female.

Research Question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Are females discriminated against in promotion decisions made by male managers?*

The Experiment Outcome
----------------------

+------+--------+--------------+-----+
|Gender|Promoted|Not Promoted  |Total|
+======+========+==============+=====+
|male  |21      |3             |24   |
+------+--------+--------------+-----+
|female|14      |10            |24   |
+------+--------+--------------+-----+
|Total |35      |13            |48   |
+------+--------+--------------+-----+


.. code:: python

    males_promoted = 21
    females_promoted = 14
    gender_difference = males_promoted - females_promoted
    gender_count = 24
    



Point Estimate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The difference in proportions of promotions is the point estimate for the population.

.. math::


   \frac{21}{24}- \frac{14}{24}&=\frac{7}{24}
